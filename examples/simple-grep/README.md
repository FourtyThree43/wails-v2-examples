This example allows the user to chose a directory or a file to search for text in.  It uses the OpenDirectoryDialog and OpenFileDialog functions, respectively, to do this.

It also uses the MessageDialog function to notify the user if either the path or the pattern has not been entered.

It uses regular expressions to perform the search.
