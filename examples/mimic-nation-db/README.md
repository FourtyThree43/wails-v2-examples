# README

Instead of using an actual database (like the nation-db example does), this example uses a text file containing the data from the "countries" table of the Mariadb sample database (nation). Therefore, it is not necessary to have a MariaDb or mysql database server running.

That text file (countries.txt) is provided in this directory.
