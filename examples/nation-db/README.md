# README

This example has special requirements.

First, either a mariadb database server (https://mariadb.com/) or a mysql database server (https://www.mysql.com/) must be installed and running.

This application was tested using the Mariadb Community Server (https://mariadb.com/products/community-server/). In theory, any mariadb or mysql database server should work.

Second, the MariaDb sample database (nation) must be downloaded and then loaded.  See https://www.mariadbtutorial.com/getting-started/mariadb-sample-database/ for instructions, specically the section entitled "Load the MariaDB sample database".

If you do not want to do these steps, please see the mimic-nation-db example.
