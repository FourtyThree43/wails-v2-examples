# README

This example retrieves information about various countries from a web API. It allows the user to retrieve data about a particular country. It also displays a lists of countries sorted by population, sorted by area, and sorted by population density.

If you run this example in Windows and perform a query on a selected country, you might notice that the country's flag does not appear where it should.  Instead there might be two letters in its place. If you are interested in seeing the flags, then you might want to run the country-api-windows example instead.
