# README

This example retrieves information about various countries from a web API. It allows the user to retrieve data about a particular country. It also displays a lists of countries sorted by population, sorted by area, and sorted by population density.

Normally, I would want to take advantage of the cross-platform nature of Wails and provide a single application that could be run on multiple platforms. However, the country-api example does not display the country flags on Windows so this example is being offered as an alternative.  It uses a custom font from github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji to displays the flags.
