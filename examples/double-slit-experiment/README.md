## About

This example attempts to emulate the physics experiment known as the "Two-slit Experiment" or the "Double-slit Experiment". It is not intended to emulate the actual experiment in a precise manner.

In a single-slit experiment light is shined towards a screen with one slit.  The light is spread out over the detection screen.  In a double-slit experiment light is shined towards a screen with two slits.  In this case, however, bright and dark bands are produced on the screen.

Numerous web sites and books that provide more detailed information exist.  The book, "Quantum Enigma" written by Bruce Rosenblum and Fred Kuttner" contains a chapter entitled "The Two-Slit Experiment" which might be of interest to some.


## Developing, Building & Distributing

You might need to use `wails dev -f` instead of `wails dev` the first time that you run the application.  Likewise, you might need to use `wails build -f` instead of `wails build` the first time that you build the application.


## Using the Application

You will be able to select either the "Start Single-Slit Experiment" button or the "Start Double-Slit Experiment" button.  However, you will not be able to "perform" both "expiments" at the same time.

The mouse should work as expected.  However, if using the keyboard, you should press the "Tab" key.  If the first button is not selected, then try to "Alt-Tab" away from the application and then back to it and then press the "Tab" key.

If the two boxes containing the two "experiments" are not next to each other in a row, then you can try resizing the screen until they are.
